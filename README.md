# Caroonify Images with OpenCV
This Repository is part of Mid Year Project Boot Camp as a Machine Learning Intern at Intern'spedia.

• Worked on implementing a system to Caroonify Images and turn them into their cartoon version. By applying machine learning methods with OpenCV and unsupervised learning.• Worked on implementing a system to Caroonify Images and turn them into their cartoon version.

## Cartoonify Images Steps
1. Converting Images to GrayScale

2. Applying Median Blur Filter

3. Retrieving Edges from the image

4. Reducing the color palette by KMeans Clustering

5. Reducing Noise by applying a bilateral filter

6. And Finally Gathering all these steps by BitWise_And and Creating The Cartoonified Image
